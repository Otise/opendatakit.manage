  <h1>ODK Manage - Readme</h1>
</div>

<div class="contents">
<h2>Overview</h2>

ODK Manage is a tool in the Open Data Kit (ODK) toolset. ODK Manage is designed 
to track and manage devices throughout an ODK deployment. 
<p>
ODK Manage allows a deployment manager to automatically keep track of all the devices 
in a deployment, including IMEI number, phone number, username, and more, all from 
a web site hosted on the Google App Engine platform. Devices using ODK Manage 
automatically register their information with the web server and update it whenever it 
changes.
<p>
ODK Manage also allows managers to schedule maintenance operations on registered 
devices. These operations include downloading forms to ODK, and installing or 
updating software on the phone.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

ODK Manage has two components: the <strong>Manage Client</strong>, which runs 
on the <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> platform, and the 
<strong>Manage Server</strong>, which runs on 
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.

<h3>Download ODK Manage</h3>
<div class='box'>
ODK Manage can be downloaded from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-data-kit/">
Google Code site</a>. Click on the <strong>Source</strong> tab for access to the SVN repository. 
You will want to checkout trunk/odk-manage. The <strong>mobile</strong> 
folder contains the Android client code, and the <strong>web</strong> folder contains the 
server code for Google App Engine
</div>

<h3>Setting up the Manage Server</h3>
<div class='box'>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://appengine.google.com">Sign up</a> for an App Engine Account. Create an application to host ODK Manage.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">Download</a> the app engine SDK.</li>
<li>Edit {odk-manage}/web/war/WEB-INFO/appengine-web.xml, and insert your appengine application name in the 
<strong>Application</strong> field.</li>
<li>Open {odk-manage}/web/src/org/odk/manage/server/AdminAccountsConfig.java, and enter the gmail addresses of
all the people who you want to be able to access the manage admin page. Don't worry; you can add more later!</li>
<li>In the terminal, go to the folder where you installed the Google App Engine SDK (it will probably be called <strong>google_appengine</strong>). 
Type <strong>./appcfg.py update {odk-manage}/web</strong>. You will be prompted for your gmail address and 
password. After entering them, it should successfully install the ODK Manage Server.
<li>Do a test run to make sure everything's working. Visit the server at <strong>{application-name}.appspot.com</strong>.
You should be prompted for gmail credentials; you'll need to enter a gmail account that you listed in AdminAccountsConfig! 
You can also see the status of your application by going to <a href="http://appengine.google.com">http://appengine.google.com</a> and 
clicking on the application. The <strong>Logs</strong> tab is a great way to see what's happening and diagnose any problems.</li>
<li>You now have an empty ODK Manage server. Next, you'll want to install the ODK Manage client on your Android phone. 
If you plan to use SMS for your deployment, read <a href="#sms">Setting up SMS with ODK Manage</a>.
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Setting up the Manage Client</h3>


If you just want to install a client with all the default settings, you can download and install a compiled 
APK by pointing your Android browser at the latest Odk Manage Client release on the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-data-kit/downloads/list">downloads page</a>.
<div class="box">
<ol>
<li>Open the web browser on your android phone. Go to http://code.google.com/p/open-data-kit/downloads/list.</li>
<li>Click on the version of OdkManageClient_xxx.apk that you want.</li>
<li>In the applications folder, click on ODK Manage, go to settings, and configure them.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<p>
If you want to customize the client and compile it on your own, follow these instructions:
<div class='box'>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r3/index.html">Download</a> the Android SDK.</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html">Download</a> the ADT plugin 
for Eclipse. If you don't have Eclipse, you can download it <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">here</a>. You 
can technically compile/develop Android code without Eclipse, I wouldn't advise it.</li>
<li>Create a new Android Project in Eclipse, and use Existing Source, pointing Eclipse to 
{odk-manage}/mobile. In the Eclipse Android Project setup wizard, ou can use any project name 
and any application name. Use the package name <strong>org.odk.manage.android</strong>, 
and do not create an Activity.</li>
<li>In Eclipse, open up {ODK Manage}/src/org.odk.manage.android/Constants.java. At the top of the 
file, there are some fields that you may want to customize. In particular, you can customize the 
defaults for what server Manage will connect to, and whether it will use GPRS, SMS, or just Wifi 
for its communications. Read the <a href="#comm_strategy">Manage communication strategy</a> section 
for more information on how Manage uses GPRS, SMS, and Wifi.</li>
<li>Right click on the project, and go to <strong>Run->Android Application</strong>. This should 
run the application in an emulator or on your phone if its plugged in. You can find the APK at 
{odk-manage}/mobile/bin/***.apk. You can post this APK online and point Android browser at it 
to download it. If you want to install an APK on a non-development phone, you will need to 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html">sign the application</a>.</li>
</ol>
</div>


<h2>Using ODK Manage</h2>

<h3>Configuring a phone</h3>
Once you have ODK Manage client on a phone, you will need to configure it (unless 
you have compiled Manage with the correct defaults). Open the ODK Manage application 
on the phone, and click on Settings. You will want to set your user ID, set Server URL 
to the base URL of the Manage server (e.g. manage1.appspot.com), and you will probably 
want to turn off "Use SMS" (unless you have SMS configured on your server).
<p/>
Once Manage is installed, your phone should automatically register itself with the Manage 
server when it is connected to the internet, but you can speed up the process by clicking 
on "Register Phone".

<h3>The Manage admin web page</h3>

The manage admin page is located at the root of your appengine instance (e.g. manage1.appspot.com).
<p/>
When you get to the admin page, you will be asked to sign in. If your gmail account is not 
in the account list in AdminAccountConfig.java, you will not be able to access Manage. We 
need to be careful about security, because Manage admins have a lot of power over their 
deployed phones (e.g. they can install any program on any phone).
<p/>
Once you are on the admin page, you should see a table with all of your deployment's registered 
devices in it. If no devices are registered, the table will be empty. Each row in the table will 
have several different columns:
<div class='box'>
<ul>
  <li><strong>IMEI:</strong> The IMEI of the device.</li>
  <li><strong>User ID:</strong> The User ID entered on the settings page of the ODK Manage client.</li>
  <li><strong>Phone #:</strong> The phone number of the devices; blank if the SIM card is not installed.</li>
  <li><strong>Tasks:</strong> The number of <a href="#tasks">tasks</a> of each type (yellow=pending, green=success, red=failed) for this device.</li>
  <li><strong>View Tasks:</strong> Click here to view the tasks for this phone and delete tasks..</li>
  <li><strong>SMS:</strong> If this field says <strong>Yes</strong>, then you can send SMS to this device.</li>
  <li><strong>Last Contacted:</strong> The last time this device checked in with the server, either by registering, asking for new tasks, or giving a status update.</li>
</ul>
</div>

If a device has pending tasks, that device will appear yellow. If a device has failed tasks, that 
device will appear red. You can remove pending or failed tasks from a device by clicking <strong>
View Tasks</strong> for that device.

<a name="tasks"></a>
<h3>Actions/Tasks</h3>

At the top of the admin console there is a <strong>Perform Action</strong> box. 
The items in this drop-down menu are actions you can perform on phones. To perform an 
action, select the  action you want to perform from the menu, and fill in the required 
fields. You also need to select which devices you want to perform the action on, by 
checking their checkboxes.
<p/>
Some actions are <strong>Task</strong> actions; that is, they schedule a particular 
task to be executed on the selected devices. 
<p/>
The following tasks are available in the current version of ODK Manage:
<div class="box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Add Form:</strong> Add a form to ODK Collect's form list on the phone.</li>
You need to provide the URL where the form is located on the web. This must be entered 
in standardized format, e.g. <i>http://www.example.com/forms/myForm.xml</i>. 
<p/>
If you are using <i>ODK Aggregate</i> to store your forms, just enter the 
URL of your aggregate application (e.g. http://aggregate.appspot.com), and you will 
be able to choose from a list of Aggregate's forms when you choose <strong>Add Form</strong>.
<li><strong>Install Package:</strong> Install or re-install a software package (e.g. ODK Collect) 
on the devices.</li>
This task makes it easy to push software updates or new software to deployed phones. 
You can even send new versions of ODK Manage. 
<p/>
You need to be very careful in how you fill out the fields for an Install Package task. 
Under package URL, enter the URL where the package APK file is located in standardized format, e.g. 
<i>http://www.example.com/apk/OdkCollect.apk</i>.
Under package name, <i>you must enter the actual package name (not file name) for the 
apk you are installing</i>. For example, ODK Collect has the package name <i>org.odk.collect.android</i>.
If you don't set the package name correctly, Manage will not be able to detect when the 
package is installed. The easiest way to find the package name for a package is to look at 
AndroidManifest.xml in the source code, and look for something like 
&lt;manifest package="org.odk.manage.android"&gt; right at the top. If you don't have the source 
code, it is pretty tricky: one option is to install the package on a phone and use <strong>adb logcat</strong>
 to find out the package name when it's added. We are looking for ways to simplify this process.
</ul>
</div>

There are also other actions you can perform in the actions panel that do not schedule tasks.
The actions provided by the current version are: 

<div class="box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Send New Task Notification SMS:</strong> Sends an SMS message to the selected phones 
with a special keyword that notifies the Manage client that there are new tasks on the server.</li>
This prompts the client to connect to the server and download the task list. The SMS can also 
contain a message (e.g. 'enter data range as soon as possible'). This is helpful in configurations 
where the client is configured to check in with the server on a very infrequent basis, or never.
<p/>
<strong>Note:</strong> You can only perform this action if the Manage server is configured 
to use SMS - if the <i>SMS</i> column for your devices say Yes, then you're good to go.
<li><strong>Send SMS Message:</strong> Sends an SMS with your message to the selected devices.</li> 
<strong>Note:</strong> You can only perform this action if the Manage server is configured 
to use SMS - if the <i>SMS</i> column for your devices say Yes, then you're good to go.
</ul>
</div>

It is possible to develop new actions or tasks for ODK Manage. See the 
<a href="#customize_actions_tasks">Customizing Actions or Tasks</a> section.

<h3>How/when tasks will be executed on the phone</h3>

There are various triggers that cause the ODK Manage service to download new 
tasks from the server and/or attempt to execute the tasks it has already downloaded.
<p/>
If one of the following triggers occurs:
<div class="box">
<ul>
<li><strong>Timer: </strong>It's been longer than 
<i>org.odk.manage.android.Constants.TASK_REQUEST_PERIOD_MS</i> since the phone last 
checked in.</li>
<li><strong>New Tasks Notification SMS: </strong>A new tasks notification SMS 
is sent from the server (i.e. an SMS from the server starting with ODK-MANAGE-NT).</li>
<li><strong>Manual Sync: </strong>The user opens the ODK Manage application and 
presses <i>Sync</i>.</li>
</ul>
</div>

then ODK Manage will attempt to download the new tasks list. If there is no connectivity, 
ODK Manage will wait until connectivity is available and then download the new tasks list.
<p/>
When ODK Manage downloads new tasks, it immediately tries to execute them. If it cannot 
execute them (e.g. no internet connection, user cancels install, etc.), Manage will try 
again intermittently or when connectivity changes. If a task fails three times, it's status 
will be changed to FAILED, and it will not be attempted any additional times.

<h2>Advanced Features</h2>

<a name="sms"></a>
<h3>Using SMS with ODK Manage</h3>

To use SMS with ODK Manage, the Manage server needs a way to send and receive SMS. 
There are several possibilities for SMS-enabling the Manage server.
<div class="box">
<ol>
<li>Use an SMS web gateway like Clickatell.</li>
<li>Hack together your own SMS gateway using a tool like FrontlineSMS or WinSMS.</li>
<li>Use Google's internal appengine SMS API. Since this API is not public, only Google 
projects (or Google-supported projects) can use this option.</li>
</div>

You will need to edit the ODK Manage server source code to connect to SMS. Here is how: 

<div class="box">
<ol>
<li>Look in org.odk.manage.server.sms for an SmsService implementation that 
supports your gateway (e.g. ClickatellSmsService). If one exists, you can configure it 
and then skip to the last step</li>
<li>If no SmsService exists, you will need to create one yourself. Make a new class 
in org.odk.manage.server.sms that implements SmsService. You may want to use ExampleSmsService.java 
as a guide for how to implement your service.</li>
In most cases, you will probably want to send an SMS by making an HTTP request, and receive 
an SMS by receiving an HTTP request. Therefore, (a) your sendSms method will probably use the appengine 
URL fetch API, and (b) you will probably need to create an additional servlet to receive SMS (remember to 
register its URL in web.xml) and pass it on to your SmsService which will then forward it to listeners. 
This is all described in ExampleSmsService.java.
<li>Open org.odk.manage.server.sms.SmsServiceFactory and set the <i>service</i> variable to the SmsService
you want to use</li>.
<li>Once you have the server up and running, you will need to go change the settings on the clients 
to Use SMS and set the server SMS number. You can either change the default in the client source code, 
or change the setting manually on the phones.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<a name="customize_actions_tasks"></a>
<h3>Adding new Tasks or Actions</h3>

<strong>Adding a new task type on the server</strong>
<div class="box">
<ol>
<li>Modify org.odk.manage.server.model.Task by adding the new task type to the TaskType enum.</li>
<li>Modify org.odk.manage.server.servlet.ManageAdminServlet to provide options/inputs for new actions (look for 'add new actions here' comments for template code).</li>
<strong>Note: </strong> Tasks can have 3 string properties: name, url, and extras. These fields are set by looking at the request parameters YOUR_ACTION_TYPE.name, YOUR_ACTION_TYPE.url, and YOUR_ACTION_TYPE.extras, respectively. 
Therefore, if you want the user to set the task url, for example, create an HTML field in the action inputs div like the following: &lt;input type='text' name='YOUR_ACTION_TYPE.url' /&gt;.
</ol>
</div>

<strong>Adding a new task type on the client</strong>
<div class="box">
<ol>
<li>Modify org.odk.manage.android.model.Task by adding the new task type to the TaskType enum.</li>
<li>Modify org.odk.manage.android.OdkManageService#attemptTask (look for 'add new task type' for template code). You will need to write a function to carry out your new action.</li>
</ol>
</div>

<strong>Adding a non-task action on the server</strong>
<p>
You may want to add an action that is not a task (e.g. send an SMS message, add a comment, etc.) Here are the steps to do so:
<div class="box">
<ol>
<li>Modify org.odk.manage.server.servlet.ManageAdminServlet to provide options/inputs for new actions (look for 'add new actions here' comments for template code)</li>
<li>Modify org.odk.manage.server.servlet.DoActionServlet#handleNonTaskAction to handle the action (look for 'add new actions here' comments for template code)</li>
</ol>
