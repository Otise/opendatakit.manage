  <h1>ODK Manage - Readme</h1>
</div>

<div class="contents">
<h2>Overview</h2>

ODK Manage is a tool in the Open Data Kit (ODK) toolset. ODK Manage is designed 
to track and manage devices throughout an ODK deployment. 
<p>
ODK Manage allows a deployment manager to automatically keep track of all the devices 
in a deployment, including IMEI number, phone number, username, and more, all from 
a web site hosted on the Google App Engine platform. Devices using ODK Manage 
automatically register their information with the web server and update it whenever it 
changes.
<p>
ODK Manage also allows managers to schedule maintenance operations on registered 
devices. These operations include downloading forms to ODK, and installing or 
updating software on the phone.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

ODK Manage has two components: the <strong>Manage Client</strong>, which runs 
on the <a href="http://www.android.com/">Android</a> platform, and the 
<strong>Manage Server</strong>, which runs on 
<a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/">Google App Engine</a>.

<h3>Download ODK Manage</h3>
<div class='box'>
ODK Manage can be downloaded from the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-data-kit/">
Google Code site</a>. Click on the <strong>Source</strong> tab for access to the SVN repository. 
You will want to checkout trunk/odk-manage. The <strong>mobile</strong> 
folder contains the Android client code, and the <strong>web</strong> folder contains the 
server code for Google App Engine
</div>

<h3>Setting up the Manage Server</h3>
<div class='box'>
<ol>
<li><a href="http://appengine.google.com">Sign up</a> for an App Engine Account. Create an application to host ODK Manage.</li>
<li><a href="http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html">Download</a> the app engine SDK.</li>
<li>Edit {odk-manage}/web/war/WEB-INFO/appengine-web.xml, and insert your appengine application name in the 
<strong>Application</strong> field.</li>
<li>Open {odk-manage}/web/src/org/odk/manage/server/AdminAccountsConfig.java, and enter the gmail addresses of
all the people who you want to be able to access the manage admin page. Don't worry; you can add more later!</li>
<li>In the terminal, go to the folder where you installed the Google App Engine SDK (it will probably be called <strong>google_appengine</strong>). 
Type <strong>./appcfg.py update {odk-manage}/web</strong>. You will be prompted for your gmail address and 
password. After entering them, it should successfully install the ODK Manage Server.
<li>Do a test run to make sure everything's working. Visit the server at <strong>{application-name}.appspot.com</strong>.
You should be prompted for gmail credentials; you'll need to enter a gmail account that you listed in AdminAccountsConfig! 
You can also see the status of your application by going to <a href="appengine.google.com">appengine.google.com</a> and 
clicking on the application. The <strong>Logs</strong> tab is a great way to see what's happening and diagnose any problems.</li>
<li>You now have an empty ODK Manage server. Next, you'll want to install the ODK Manage client on your Android phone. 
If you plan to use SMS for your deployment, read <a href="sms">Setting up SMS with ODK Manage</a>.
</ol>
</div>

<h3>Setting up the Manage Client</h3>
<div class='box'>
If you just want to install a client with all the default settings, you can download and install a compiled 
APK by pointing your Android browser at the latest Odk Manage Client release on the 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/open-data-kit/downloads/list">downloads page</a>.
You'll have to input the manage server manually in the settings page on your phone.
<p>
If you want to customize the client and compile it on your own, follow these instructions:

<ol>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/1.5_r3/index.html">Download</a> the Android SDK.</li>
<li><a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html">Download</a> the ADT plugin 
for Eclipse. If you don't have Eclipse, you can download it <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">here</a>. You 
can technically compile/develop Android code without Eclipse, I wouldn't advise it.</li>
<li>Create a new Android Project in Eclipse, and use Existing Source, pointing Eclipse to 
{odk-manage}/mobile. In the Eclipse Android Project setup wizard, ou can use any project name 
and any application name. Use the package name <strong>org.odk.manage.android</strong>, 
and do not create an Activity.</li>
<li>In Eclipse, open up {ODK Manage}/src/org.odk.manage.android/Constants.java. At the top of the 
file, there are some fields that you may want to customize. In particular, you can customize the 
defaults for what server Manage will connect to, and whether it will use GPRS, SMS, or just Wifi 
for its communications. Read the <a href="#comm_srategy">Manage communication strategy</a> section 
for more information on how Manage uses GPRS, SMS, and Wifi.</li>
<li>Right click on the project, and go to <strong>Run->Android Application</strong>. This should 
run the application in an emulator or on your phone if its plugged in. You can find the APK at 
{odk-manage}/mobile/bin/***.apk. You can post this APK online and point Android browser at it 
to download it. If you want to install an APK on a non-development phone, you will need to 
<a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/publishing/app-signing.html">sign the application</a></li>.
